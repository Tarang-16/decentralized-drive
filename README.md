# Decentralized Drive

Decentralized Drive is a project that aims to create a decentralized and secure file storage and sharing solution using blockchain technology. It allows users to store files securely, control their data, and share files with others in a peer-to-peer manner.

## Features

- Secure file storage: Files are encrypted and stored in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology.
- Data ownership: Users have full control and ownership of their files without relying on a central authority.
- Peer-to-peer sharing: Users can securely share files with others without intermediaries.
- Immutable records: Files and transaction history are stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and transparency.

To run the Decentralized Drive project locally, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- Hardhat
- Ganache (for local development blockchain)
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) node
